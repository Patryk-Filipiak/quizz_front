# Quiz App
STATE: REWRITING BASICS 50%;

## About the Project
This project is a web application designed for playing single and multiplayer quizzes. It also allows the community to contribute by proposing new questions or categories, enhancing the collaborative aspect of the application.

## Key Objectives
- **Simplicity and Code Clarity:** Ensuring the codebase remains simple and clear for ease of maintenance and scalability.
- **High Reusability of Components:** Emphasis on creating modular components that can be reused throughout the application.

## Technologies Used
This project is developed using React (TypeScript) and includes:
  - SASS for styling.
  - Axios for API requests.
  - Redux for state management.
  - Context Provider for managing non-serializable state data (e.g., popup type: ReactNode | null).

## Project Structure
src/
  - index.tsx # Entry point
  - /API # Axios API requests
  - /Components # Reusable components
  - /Pages # Pages managed by the router
  - /State # Redux state management
  - /Context # Service Context
  - /Styles # Common SCSS styles

  ### Project Overview
- `index.tsx` renders the `Layout` component wrapped in `BrowserRouter`, `AppService` (Context), and `Redux Provider`.
- `Components/Layout` comprises the Header, Page, Footer, Toasts, and Router. It is responsible for the layout of the main elements of the application.

## Additional Notes
- **Testing:** Consider adding unit and integration tests to ensure reliability and stability.
- **Documentation:** Maintain up-to-date documentation, especially if community contributions are expected.
- **Responsive Design:** Ensure the application is responsive and functions well across various devices.
- **Security:** Focus on security aspects, especially since the application allows community contributions.
- **User Experience:** Regular UX/UI testing to ensure the application is user-friendly and intuitive.

## Conclusion
This project aims to provide a robust and user-friendly platform for quiz enthusiasts. With its focus on simplicity, reusability, and effective state management, it is poised to offer a delightful experience to its users.
